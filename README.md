## Description  
It's my portfolio! I deployed it incorrectly but it's up and running so I'm happy with it!

## Screenshots

## Demo

## Installation
Grab it off github, run "npm install" and then run "npm run start". But this isn't really something you install 
## Usage
No functionality, it's just my portfolio! Easy routing and reactjs
## Contribution
Email me! I'm sure my code is very sloppy in a professional's eyes. I wanted to go for a more minimalistic style for this portfolio and I actually liked it a lot. It lets you focus on the contents rather than the page itself.
